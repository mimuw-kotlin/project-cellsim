# Cellsim

## Authors
- Maciej Gryz (@folicore on GitHub)

## Description
cellsim is a Kotlin package, with purpose of simplyfying process of making cellular automata, while still giving user a lot of freedom of possible behaviours.

## Features
- creating fully working automata with defining just a few functions and objects defining its behaviour
- designing cell behaviour with any Kotlin functions (with proper arguments and return type)
- some level of runtime safety, trying to detect errors made in urer's cell bahaviour
- optimised model of simulation (multithreading, etc.)
- ability to modify cells by hand between steps
- console display
- GUI to run simulations (2nd part)

## Plan
In the first part, I'm planning on implementing base features of the package.

In the second part, I'm planning to implement GUI.

## Libraries
- Compose Multiplatform
